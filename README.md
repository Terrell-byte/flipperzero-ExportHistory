## How does it work?
This script allows you to export your browser history to a Discord webhook. It uses the Ducky language to automate the process and make it as easy as possible. By running this script, you can have your entire browsing history sent directly to a specified Discord channel, where you can view and analyze it at your convenience. This is a great tool for anyone who wants to keep track of their online activity or track the browsing habits of others. The script is simple to use and requires no additional software or setup. Just plug in your Ducky and let it do the work for you!

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/Terrell-byte/CheckIT.git](https://github.com/Terrell-byte/flipperzero-ExportHistory.git)
```

2. Edit the Export_Browser_History.txt file
Set the discord webhook url
```
$url="PASTE URL HERE"
```

3. Copy the file to our Flipper Zero or Ducky device

4. And you are read to go!
